# 🍽️ Zomato-Style Restaurant Platform Backend

Welcome to the backend component of our Zomato-style restaurant platform 🎉. This project contains a robust set of features, including routes, controllers, services, models, and validation for managing various entities, such as cities, states, countries, restaurants, menus, tokens, users, and more 🍕.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To kickstart your Zomato-like project, you'll need Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your local machine.

## 🏗️ Project Structure

Our project is organized into various sections:

- 🌐 `src`: The heart of the application, containing the source code.
  - 🎮 `controllers`: Where route handlers for different entities are defined.
  - 🗂️ `models`: Home to data models and database schemas.
  - 🚦 `routes`: Define the API routes and endpoints.
  - 🧰 `services`: Where all the magic happens; it contains the business logic and data processing.
  - ✅ `validations`: Ensures data is secure by implementing request and data validation.
- 📝 `config`: Store configuration files like environment variables.
- 🏢 `db`: Contains database schemas and scripts.
- ⚙️ `middlewares`: Implement custom middleware.
- 🧩 `utils`: Utility functions and helper modules.

## ⚙️ Installation

Getting started is a breeze:

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/manalichovatiya/Node-js-ZOMATO.git

## 🌐 API Routes
API routes are your gateway to functionality. They are defined in the src/routes directory, and you can dive deeper into each route's specifics and request/response formats by checking out our API documentation.

## 📊 Models
Discover the inner workings of your database by exploring the src/models directory. Each model represents a database table and its structure.

## 🎮 Controllers
The src/controllers directory is where HTTP requests meet their destiny. These controllers interact with services to fetch or manipulate data, ensuring seamless responses for clients.

## 💼 Services
In the src/services directory, the magic happens. These modules house business logic, data processing, and interaction with the database. Controllers rely on services to make things happen.

## 🔐 Authentication
Experience secure user authentication by understanding the mechanisms for different user roles (owner, admin, super admin, user). Check out our authentication documentation for an in-depth understanding.

## 🧪 Validation
Request and data validation is handled in the src/validations directory. Our validation middleware ensures that incoming data is valid and safe.
